# Cloudflare Identifier

## Overview
Cloudflare Identifier is a Python script designed to determine if a website uses Cloudflare services by analyzing its HTTP response headers. It checks for Cloudflare-specific headers as well as other common security-related headers, providing insights into the website's security measures.

## Features
- **Cloudflare Detection**: Identifies the presence of Cloudflare-specific headers such as 'cf-ray' and 'cf-cache-status'.
- **Security Headers Analysis**: Detects common security headers like 'Strict-Transport-Security' and 'X-Frame-Options'.
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: Provides clear feedback on whether Cloudflare services are detected or not.
- **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions effectively when the domain cannot be reached.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` module

## Usage
To use the Cloudflare Identifier, run the script from the command line. You will be prompted to enter a domain name (without http/https), and the script will fetch and analyze the headers returned by the server.

```bash
python cloudflare_identifier.py
